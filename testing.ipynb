    "**Experiment 1: Single-Stage Combined Approach**\n",
    "-   **Description:** This experiment employs a single LLM call with a single prompt that encompasses all instructions: analyzing the policy, identifying affirmations, formulating questions (with unique IDs), and logically structuring them into the specified JSON tree according to the dependency rule.\n",
    "-   **Prompt Design:** The prompt combines all steps, including explicit JSON schema instructions and examples for nesting.\n",

    "**Experiment 2: Two-Stage Sequential (In-Chat)**\n",
    "-   **Description:** This approach involves two sequential LLM turns within the same conversational context.\n",
    "    -   **Turn 1:** The LLM receives the policy excerpt and instructions for generating the \"True\" questions, each with a unique ID, as a simple bulleted list (order does not matter here).\n",
    "    -   **Turn 2:** The LLM is then prompted (in the same chat session, retaining memory of Turn 1's input and output) to take the questions it just generated and reorder them into the JSON tree structure according to the logical dependency rule.\n",
    "-   **Prompt Design:**\n",
    "    -   **Prompt for Turn 1 (Question Generation):** Similar to the \"Prompt 1: Question Generation\" detailed below, including the requirement for a unique ID for each question.\n",
    "    -   **Prompt for Turn 2 (JSON Ordering):** Instructs the LLM to take \"the questions you just generated\" and structure them into the JSON tree, explicitly stating the nesting logic and the **logical contingency rule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment 3: Divorced Two-Stage (No Policy Context for Re-ordering)**\n",
    "-   **Description:** This experiment separates the two tasks entirely, employing two distinct LLM calls (potentially to different instances or fresh contexts). The crucial difference here is that the LLM performing the ordering task *does not* receive the original privacy policy text.\n",
    "    -   **Model A Call:** Receives the policy excerpt and generates the questions with IDs as a bulleted list (similar to Turn 1 of Experiment 2).\n",
    "    -   **Model B Call:** Receives *only the list of generated questions* and instructions to reorder them into the JSON tree structure based on logical dependencies.\n",
    "-   **Prompt Design:**\n",
    "    -   **Prompt for Model A:** Identical to \"Prompt 1: Question Generation\" below.\n",
    "    -   **Prompt for Model B:** Similar to \"Prompt 2: JSON Tree Ordering,\" but the `Original Privacy Policy Excerpt` is **omitted**. The ordering model must infer dependencies purely from the question text and IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment 4: Divorced Two-Stage (With Policy Context for Re-ordering)**\n",
    "-   **Description:** This is a two-stage approach with distinct LLM calls, where the LLM performing the ordering task is *re-provisioned* with the original privacy policy context.\n",
    "    -   **Model A Call:** Receives the policy excerpt and generates the questions with IDs as a bulleted list (identical to Model A in Experiment 3).\n",
    "    -   **Model B Call:** Receives *both* the original privacy policy excerpt *and* the list of generated questions, along with instructions to reorder them into the JSON tree structure.\n",
    "-   **Prompt Design:**\n",
    "    -   **Prompt for Model A:** Identical to \"Prompt 1: Question Generation\" below.\n",
    "    -   **Prompt for Model B:** Identical to \"Prompt 2: JSON Tree Ordering\" below, where the `Original Privacy Policy Excerpt` is explicitly included.\n",

    "**Role:** You are a Data Protection Officer (DPO) specializing in analyzing and tracking the evolution of Privacy Policies. Your expertise lies in identifying actionable statements and core privacy principles within legal texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze an excerpt of a privacy policy and extract all concrete statements (affirmations) made within it, then rephrase these affirmations as a set of concise, \"True\" questions, each with a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Policy Excerpt Analysis:**\n",
    "    *   Carefully read the provided `Privacy Policy Excerpt`.\n",
    "    *   Identify all explicit statements, declarations, or affirmations made by the policy regarding the collection, processing, storage, sharing, security, transfer, or user rights concerning personal data.\n",
    "    *   Focus on what the policy *states as a fact* or *affirms as its practice or intention*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Identification of Key Affirmations:**\n",
    "    *   For each identified statement, determine if it represents a significant action, condition, or commitment related to personal data handling.\n",
    "    *   Assign an identifier (e.g., \"Q1\", \"Q2\", \"Q3\") to each distinct affirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Question Formulation:**\n",
    "    *   For each key affirmation identified in Step 2, formulate a question that:\n",
    "        *   **Starts with the precise prefix:** `Does the privacy policy affirm that...`\n",
    "        *   **Is followed by a statement that is *verifiably true* based *only* on the provided excerpt.** The statement must directly reflect an affirmation from the text.\n",
    "        *   **Ends with a question mark (`?`).**\n",
    "        *   Is concise and directly to the point, avoiding speculation or information not explicitly stated in the excerpt.\n",
    "    *   Present each question with its assigned ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Output Generation:**\n",
    "    *   Present the formulated questions as a JSON, where each item includes the question ID and the question itself. The order of questions in this list does not matter for this step; simply list them as they are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations:**\n",
    "*   **Truthfulness:** Every statement embedded within your question *must* be directly supported and affirmed by the exact wording of the provided `Privacy Policy Excerpt`. Do not infer or speculate.\n",
    "*   **Completeness (within excerpt):** Aim to capture all significant affirmations related to personal data within the given text.\n",
    "*   **Conciseness:** Keep each question focused on a single, clear point.\n",

    "**Role:** You are a Data Protection Officer (DPO) specializing in analyzing and tracking the evolution of Privacy Policies. Your expertise lies in identifying actionable statements and core privacy principles within legal texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze an excerpt of a privacy policy and extract all concrete statements (affirmations) made within it, then rephrase these affirmations as a set of concise, \"True\" questions, each with a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Policy Excerpt Analysis:**\n",
    "    *   Carefully read the provided `Privacy Policy Excerpt`.\n",
    "    *   Identify all explicit statements, declarations, or affirmations made by the policy regarding the collection, processing, storage, sharing, security, transfer, or user rights concerning personal data.\n",
    "    *   Focus on what the policy *states as a fact* or *affirms as its practice or intention*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Identification of Key Affirmations:**\n",
    "    *   For each identified statement, determine if it represents a significant action, condition, or commitment related to personal data handling.\n",
    "    *   Assign an identifier (e.g., \"Q1\", \"Q2\", \"Q3\") to each distinct affirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Question Formulation:**\n",
    "    *   For each key affirmation identified in Step 2, formulate a question that:\n",
    "        *   **Starts with the precise prefix:** `Does the privacy policy affirm that...`\n",
    "        *   **Is followed by a statement that is *verifiably true* based *only* on the provided excerpt.** The statement must directly reflect an affirmation from the text.\n",
    "        *   **Ends with a question mark (`?`).**\n",
    "        *   Is concise and directly to the point, avoiding speculation or information not explicitly stated in the excerpt.\n",
    "    *   Present each question with its assigned ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Output Generation:**\n",
    "    *   Present the formulated questions as a JSON, where each item includes the question ID and the question itself. The order of questions in this list does not matter for this step; simply list them as they are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations:**\n",
    "*   **Truthfulness:** Every statement embedded within your question *must* be directly supported and affirmed by the exact wording of the provided `Privacy Policy Excerpt`. Do not infer or speculate.\n",
    "*   **Completeness (within excerpt):** Aim to capture all significant affirmations related to personal data within the given text.\n",
    "*   **Conciseness:** Keep each question focused on a single, clear point.\n",
    "\n",
